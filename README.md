# Task Planner Important & Urgent

Simple Excel app, inspired by the fantastic Excel VBA Course by [TrumpExcel](https://www.youtube.com/@trumpexcel). Idea and skills needed to develop it I attribute to the course. However, the final code was developed independently by myself.

The purpose of the app is task management. Users can add new tasks, specifying their importance and urgency using the "Add a New Task" button. Upon completing a task, users can simply double-click on it and utilize the "Remove Completed Task" button to clear it from the list.

Sheet can be unprotected with no password.
